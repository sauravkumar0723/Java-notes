###     Taking User Input in Java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)

          System.in-> take one paremeter
           ==> for system i am taking the input from user will give for take from the system
* Scanner -> inbuilt class in java.
-> inside inner class method are already present
   // taking input
    Common Methods
-> int a = sc.nextInt();        // integer
-> double d = sc.nextDouble(); // double
-> String s = sc.next();       // single word
-> String line = sc.nextLine();// full line


** Using BufferedReader (Fast Input)
--> Faster than Scanner, used in competitive programming.
BufferedReader br =
    new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
String s = br.readLine();
int n = Integer.parseInt(s);
