## Java History
- Developed by Sun Microsystems
- Released in 1995
- Later acquired by Oracle

## Java-introduction
         ↓
- High level programming
- language is a medium which is need for communication
- "Programs" refers to set of instructions
- A Program is automated soln. for real-world problems
- Application -> Collections of multiple different programs.
- two types of Application
- 1. StandAlone app. -> Acess is limited & works without internet e.g = notepad, camera
  2. Web App. -> Acess is not limited & works with internet e.g = netflix, whatsapp.
- Javac --> Compiler
- JVM --> Inerpreter
- i. set of instructions is in human redeable format is konwn as HIGH LEVEL Code.
- ii. set of instructions is in binary then it is MLL.
- iii. set of instructions is partially human readable and & partially machine redeable is konwn as Byte Code.

## Execution of java Program
- 1. compilation -> converting High-level code into intermediate code. achieved by JAVAC Compiler.
  2. interpretation -> Converting intermediate code into low-level code this can achieved by Translater called JVM

                                   ↓
- MLL -> 1940
- ALL -> 1950

## Features of Java
- 1. Platform independence --> Same java programs to run different O.S
  2. WORA(Write Once Run Anywhere)
  3. Portability(Easily Movable)
  4. Architectural Netural

## Architecture of JAVA
- 1. JVM --> ensure platform independece by translating byte code into machine instructions.
  2. JRE --> Provides the necessary library and tools to excutes java program.
  3. JDk --> used for writing and compiling java Program
