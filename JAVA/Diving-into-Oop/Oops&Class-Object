### Diving into Oops
  Oop -> Object Oriented Programming:-> 
              --> Define as an approach to problem-solving to utilize the program to address the real-world Problem.
              --> It allow us to model and represent these Problem an a structure and  Organized Manner, Making it easier to create efficient and effective solution.


   ** Objects & Classes             
                Class:- 
                  -> Class can be define as a template/bluePrint with the help of JVM can create an Objects
                  Note:-> Class should be begin with a Capital Letter
                       -> If calss should have multiple Word. Every first word will be Capital Letter.
                  Object:-
                    -> An Objects is an instance of class that contains real value stored in memory. 
                     -> it creates Based on the bluePrint(class) and represent something with properties(Variables) and behaviour(methods)

                                                     ↓
                          Example:-
                                                     Student
                                   What it HAS                            What it DOES
                                   {name}                                      {studey()}
                                   {age}                                       {sleep()}
                                   {roll}                                      {eat()}



### CODE 
          // we can creat a program of object and class
             Class Student{
             int age;
             int roll;
             String name;

              pubic void study()
              {
                System.out.println("Student is studying");
              }
                 pubic void sleep()
              {
                System.out.println("Student is sleeping");
              }
              pubic void eat()
              {
                System.out.println("Student is eating");
              }

  // Main Method
               public class Main 
               {
                 Public static void main(String[] args)
                 {
                   Student s1 = new Student();
                   s1.name = "Saurav";
                   s1.age = "23";
                   s1.roll = "23"
                     System.out.println(s1.name);
                       System.out.println(s1.age);
                      System.out.println(s1.eat);
                     s1.study();
                   s1.sleep();
                   s1.eat();
                 }
               } 


  // s1 -> is refrence variable
  // new -> new  will create object of class

  ## Dry Run:- code.
     Main method starts
     JVM
       ↓
      Main method starts
        ↓
Student object s1 is created
        ↓
Values assigned:
name = "Saurav"
age = 23
roll = 23
        ↓
Printed outputs:
Saurav
23
        ↓
Method calls:
study() → "Student is studying"
sleep() → "Student is sleeping"
eat()   → "Student is eating"
