### Encapsulation
--> Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data(Variables) and Code (Methods) into a Single Unit and Hidding the internal details from Outside Acess.
--> It can achieved by declaring the class variables as Private & creating Public Getter and Setter methods to acess and Update those Variables.
--< Main Purpose of encapsulation is to Protect data from unwanted acess or modification.

Example :- An ATM is good example. you can only acess your account through specfic Options(buttons) and you cannot directly modify you bank blance. machine Control how your request is handaled.

## Code:- 
           class Book {
               private int pageNo;
                  public void Setter(int x) // setter means set the data
                     {
                        if(x>0)
                          {
                             pageNo = x;
                            } else {
                               System.out.Println("Worng data");
                            }
                       }
                      public void Getter() // getter means get the data
                        {
                          System.out.println(pageNo);
                         }
                }
               public class Main {
                  public static void main(String[] args)
                  {
                    Book b = new Book();
                    b.Setter(10);
                    b.Getter();
                 }
             }
